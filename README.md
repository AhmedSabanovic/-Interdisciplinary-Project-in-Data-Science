It offers tabs to toggle between a default map view and a CSV data view, loading relevant data from chosen CSV files and plotting various metrics for analysis.
The JavaScript file loads and merges geospatial data with CSV records, then draws an interactive map with D3. It also creates tooltips, dynamic color scales, and modals with various charts (line, scatter, combined) based on the selected dataset and parameter.
